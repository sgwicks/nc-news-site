# SG News - A Personal NC News React App

This project represents my early forays into React, and particularly with using React to render a website based heavily on communication with a backend API (to see more about that, head over to my [Northocders Now API repo](https://github.com/sgwicks/nc-news)).

## The Live Hosted Site

[SG News](https://sg-news.netlify.app/)

This site represents a Reddit-esque news/blog/social media site where registered users can browse articles by topic, comment on them, and up- or down-vote articles and comments alike.

The site is designed to be scalable from day 1, with responsive design of course, but also functionality that is ready to accept additional topics or articles and immediately integrate them into the layout.

I also tried to keep accessibility in mind while designing the site, and this can mostly be seen with the larger hitboxes for each link, and the semantic html, avoiding excessive nesting wherever possible.

The layout is designed to be responsive, using a mix of grid and flex techniques to achieve an elegant display that doesn't break when you change screen size or device. Media queries allow the display to change functionality and layout on smaller devices, too.
